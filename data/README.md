# Data

### Census Data

After running the relevant scripts per the in the project README, the `census` data folder contains the following:

* __census_data.tsv.gz__: The formatted census data by block group containing information about race/ethnicity, income, education, and employment.

* __census_data_shapefiles.shp__: Similar data as `census_data.tsv.gz`, but with the relevant shapefile for a given block group.

### 311

After running the relevant scripts per the in the project README, the `311` data folder contains the following:

* __service_names.csv__: A temporary list, by city, of the 311 service requests that can be made used to get a sense of the data.

* __complaint_categorization.csv__: A full list of all services available in the data that was used in the analysis. It is constantly updated and pulled from a collaborative [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_G3nBNMg3H88tBs2i8BO1enHWza5p8tyM_giACXvPM/edit?usp=sharing). This sheet will be automatically downloaded when running any of the analysis scripts, though you may need to give the `googlesheets4` package authentication. The determinations in this sheet were subjective, but vetted by the entire team. Categories can be found below:
    * _Request (`req_name`)_: The raw name of the possible requests in the data.
    * _Request aim (`req_aim`)_: This denotes the target of the request, whether a human (themselves, their actions, or their belongings) or a non-human entity.
    * _Legality of the event/concern reported (`legal`)_: This denotes whether or not the reported incident/concern regards a potentially illegal matter such as illegal graffiti, trash dumping, parking, etc.
    * _Adversarial nature of request (`adv`)_: This denotes whether or not a given request is adversarial to another person (themselves, their actions, their belongings of that being, or the area that that being resides in/near). In this case, we are referring to fellow citizens, and not neccessarily city entities, or citizens working on behalf of the government.
    * _Categorized topic of request (`topic`)_: This denotes the umbrella category that a given request was grouped under. While we strived to make these grouping mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, they may not always be.
    
Within each subfolder are data files for that city:

* __<data_version>_census.tsv__: Prepped and cleaned data ready for analysis. A version with shapefiles can be found in the `.shp` file below.
    
* __<data_version>_census.shp__: Prepped and cleaned 311 data ready for analysis; includes shapefiles.
