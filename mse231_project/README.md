# Analyzing Bias and Disparities in 311 Calls

### Overview
We will analyze 311 calls to answer the following question: do we see a higher volume of disturbance or conflict-centered 311 requests in city neighborhoods associated with and high proportions of people of color?

### Getting Set Up

1. Folder Structure

* __data__: cleaned data
* __data_raw__: raw data
* __docs__: data documentation and notes
* __analysis__: exploratory data analysis on your cleaned data
* __scripts__: data-cleaning scripts
* __reports__: findings to present to others

2. Clone the GitHub repo into a directory of your choosing. You can rename the folder later if you'd like.
```
git clone git@github.com:afdocherty/MSnE231-Project.git
cd MSnE231-Project
```
