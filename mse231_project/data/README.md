### Census Data

After running the relevant scripts per the in the project README, the `census` data folder contains the following:

* __census_data.tsv.gz__: The formatted census data by block group containing information about race/ethnicity, income, education, and employment.

* __census_data_shapefiles.shp__: Similar data as `census_data.tsv.gz`, but with the relevant shapefile for a given block group.
